# Design Report  

##### Introduction
This report presents the design and testing of a TicTacToe game.

##### Analysis
Our goal was to create the game TicTacToe on a remote computer using java and it was supposed to run using a console program.
 
##### Design 
The program was worked on with Pair Programming. We used Git as our source control client and hosted our repository on GitHub.


##### Test and experimentation
We can run a unit test by using the ./bin/unit_test command from the TicTacToe folder

##### Conclusion 
The program worked as it was planned and should work on every machine.
