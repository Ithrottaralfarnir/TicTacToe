# Administration manual

We've built the jar file with "**gradle build**" the next things we need to do is compile the program and run it.

To compile the program we need to run the following command from the TicTacToe folder: **./bin/compile**

After the program has been compiled you can run it by using the following command from the TicTacToe folder:
**./bin/deploy** 
- This takes our packaged .jar file and copies it in to another location. The file is then run as a java file.

This should start the program and lets you start playing the TicTacToe game. The instructions on how to play are listed when you run the program.
